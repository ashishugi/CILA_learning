    <h1> Step for using GIT</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>git init -> it will make a hidden git file in your project folder</li>
        <li>git config  -> this command is used to setup the email and username of your git account</li>
        <li> git add .  -> this command is use to add the file </li> // git add *.html will only add html files only
        <li> git commit -m "message here" -> this command is used to add the added file to a waiting / staging area </li>
        // from the waiting / staging area you can the push your file to git repository .Waiting / staging area is the 
        intermediate area between your online git repo and local files.
        <li> git status -> this tells you the status of you local files</li>
        // .gitignore file is used to except some file which you do not want to add to your repository
        <li> git remote add  origin URL -> this connect your local git to Online git</li>
        <li> git push -u origin master -> this will push your code to the online repository</li>
        <li> git push -f origin master -> this command is used if git rejects above command</li>
    </ol>
/********************************** Branches ************************************/
 // Branches are used if there are many developers and if they do not want to push the code for main project repository 
 until the project is completed , so in that case they make a new separate branch and push that branch to repository
 and if this branch works fine then we merge this with our main project branch .Main project branch is referred as master
 branch .
    <ol>
        <li>git branch name_of_branch  -> this command will create a new branch called "name_of_branch"</li>
        // now to work with the new branch create you much change your branch
        <li> git checkout name_of_branch -> this command will change your branch to "name_of_branch"</li>
        // to again switch back to master use - > git checkout master
        // after that if you need to merge the master and name_of_branch the use
        1. first comeback to master branch as you need to merge with master branch
        2. git merge name_of_branch - >this will merge all the code of master branch and name_of_branch together to master
        remember to commit both the branches to merge the code of both the branches
